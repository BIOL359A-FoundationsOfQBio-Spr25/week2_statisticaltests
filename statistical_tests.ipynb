    "### Hypothesis Testing Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a method used to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts and Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** This is our starting assumption, which typically suggests no effect or no difference. In mathematical terms, we might express it as $H_0: \\bar{X} = \\mu$, where $\\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, and $\\mu$ is the population mean we're comparing to. The null hypothesis is what you'd expect by default, without new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):** This represents the alternative belief, essentially what we suspect might be true instead of the null hypothesis. It's expressed as $H_A: \\bar{X} \\neq \\mu$ for a two-sided test, or $H_A: \\bar{X} > \\mu$ or $H_A: \\bar{X} < \\mu$ for one-sided tests. This hypothesis suggests there is an effect or a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Statistic:** A test statistic is a value calculated from the sample data, used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. It's formulated based on our hypotheses. For a mean difference test with unknown variance, it's often a _t-statistic_ given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$t = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{s_x/\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $s_x$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size. This statistic measures how far our sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is from the population mean $\\mu$, scaled by the variability of the sample. The test assumes that the two distributions have the same variance and follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Null Distribution:** This is the probability distribution of the test statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. For the _t-statistic_, this would be the _t-distribution_. The null distribution helps us understand what values of the test statistic are likely if the null hypothesis holds. When \\($H_0$\\) is true, the mean of the _t-distribution_ is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **P-value:** The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed result, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. It quantifies how unusual our data is if $H_0$ were true. A low p-value indicates that such data would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis, suggesting evidence against $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Significance Level (α):** Before conducting the test, we choose a significance level (often 0.05), which is the threshold used to decide whether the p-value is low enough to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$, concluding that our results are statistically significant.\n"

    "- The Whiskers: Extend from the box to show the range of the data, adjusted for potential outliers. Typically, they span from Q1 - 1.5IQR to Q3 + 1.5IQR.\n",
